# Simple Containerised System Health Checker
Create a basic containerised application that periodically checks the health of a system and logs the results. 

## Features:
A Dockerised application that pings a /health-check endpoint on a website I will provide every hour

Logs the result to a database, along with a timestamp and success or failure state

Renders the result as an HTML page that lists all previous checks

Choose a linting tool and apply code standards to your application :pylint?

Add checks using github actions to enforce that tests and code quality checks must pass before allowing merge to `main`

Document how a new developer can get the application working locally in a README.md

Present back to the group with some slides explaining the difference between Docker, Docker compose and how your implementation works. Cover some of the advantages / disadvantages as you see them?

Can we add a second service that relies on the one youâ€™ve dockerised (a frontend relying on an API perhaps?) Can you add it so the two get spun up and can work together.

## How to run using Docker

Build the Docker image by running the following command:
`docker build -t health-checker .`
Once the image is built, you can run a container using the following command:
`docker run health-checker`
